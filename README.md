# üç∑ CodeClause Data Science Internship

This repository contains my project submission for the CodeClause Data Science Internship, focused on predictive modeling of wine quality based on physicochemical properties.

## üìå Project: Wine Quality Prediction

- Objective: Predict the quality of wine using supervised machine learning techniques.
- Dataset: UCI Wine Quality Dataset
- Features: pH, alcohol content, residual sugar, acidity, etc.
- Models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree
- Metrics: Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Classification Report

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tech Stack

- Python (Jupyter Notebook)
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Seaborn, Matplotlib

## üß† Highlights

- In-depth data exploration and correlation analysis
- Feature selection and scaling
- Comparison of multiple classifiers with performance evaluation
